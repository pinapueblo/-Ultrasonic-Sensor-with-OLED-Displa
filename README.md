# -Ultrasonic-Sensor-with-OLED-Display

- Developed a real-time object detection system using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and a 0.96” OLED display.
- Programmed in C++ (Arduino IDE) to dynamically display “Object Detected” when an obstacle is within 10 cm.
- Implemented text centering and formatting using the Adafruit GFX library for improved UI clarity.
- Used I2C communication to connect the OLED display and optimized distance calculations for accurate readings.
